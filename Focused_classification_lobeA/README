Scripts to calculate 2D reference-free class averages and measure lobe A position

1)  'auto_align_queue' is used to classify ALL particles within a given dataset.  This is a control script that submits these jobs to a SGE cluster:

-CAN_queue.csh - Script that runs 'CAN', an executable to perform topology representing network classication
-pretreat_queue.csh - Prepares references created from 'CAN' for Multi-reference-alignment.  IMPORTANT - this scripts creates mirrors of references.
-MRA_queue.csh - Runs multi-reference-alignment for newly calculated references and particles
-incore_queue.csh - Filters references

Example of command:
[michael@ql02 12mar04a]$ ./auto_align_queue 
usage:  auto_align <# iter> <starting im> <orig im> <num particles> <starting class number> <ending class number> <filter strength>
[michael@ql02 12mar04a]$ ./auto_align_queue 10 parts_prep parts_prep 20167 600 100 0.8

2)  Resulting classums are inspected, and a list of class averages is generated (numbered in EMAN format) corresponding to averages of particles in the 'standard' view of TFIID.
In this list, a negative sign is placed in front of class average numbers for class averages that need to be mirrored.

3)  Convert this list of classums into SPIDER format:
./renumber.py [list].txt
