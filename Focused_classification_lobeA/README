Scripts to calculate 2D reference-free class averages and measure lobe A position

1)  'auto_align_queue' is used to classify ALL particles within a given dataset.  This is a control script that submits these jobs to a SGE cluster:

	-CAN_queue.csh - Script that runs 'CAN', an executable to perform topology representing network classication
	-pretreat_queue.csh - Prepares references created from 'CAN' for Multi-reference-alignment.  IMPORTANT - this scripts creates mirrors of references.
	-MRA_queue.csh - Runs multi-reference-alignment for newly calculated references and particles
	-incore_queue.csh - Filters references

	Example of command:
	[michael@ql02 12mar04a]$ ./auto_align_queue 
	usage:  auto_align <# iter> <starting im> <orig im> <num particles> <starting class number> <ending class number> <filter strength>
	[michael@ql02 12mar04a]$ ./auto_align_queue 10 parts_prep parts_prep 20167 600 100 0.8
